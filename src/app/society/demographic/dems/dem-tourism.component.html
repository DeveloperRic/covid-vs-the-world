    Here in Canada, the fear of the danger associated with the rapid spread of the new COVID-19 virus is imminent
    through aggressive decontamination measures, the clearing of supermarket shelves, and FaceTime calls becoming our
    closest form of human contact. For most of us, this pandemic means cozying up on the couch in our sweatpants for
    days on end, happily doing our part to prevent the spread of the contiguous illness with Netflix and a stockpile of
    snacks at our side. Despite the terrifying reality that may be taking place outside our door, the truth is to us
    this quarantine is nothing more than a never-ending weekend. The only down-side to the privileged is a mere lack of
    fresh-air, and that most people had to cancel their much-anticipated summer vacations.

    Throughout this whole challenging and rather sudden turn of events, there has been a lot of talk from doctors,
    politicians, officials, and friends; however, there is a very key voice that is missing from the discussion of this
    pandemic, the ones who are going to suffer the most: the Global South. While President Trump continues his rants on
    the evening news about the damage the American economy will experience, another day goes by in which the Global
    North turns a blind eye to the world’s most at-risk nations. All the Western populations such as ourselves who
    cancelled our summer vacations abroad, and now governments who are closing borders to imports collectively impose
    upon the economies of the Global South.

    Most developing nations depend on the service industry, meaning primarily tourism, to generate a majority of Gross
    Domestic Product (GDP) revenue. In the year 2017, 73.4% of Cuba’s GDP was generated from the service industry, 60.4%
    in Ecuador, 73.9% in Costa Rica, 69.1% in Fiji, 56.6% in Morocco, and 67.5% in South Africa. This is only a small
    portion of the long list of nations that will be affected. It was estimated by The Global Business Travel
    Association that “spending on travel around the world could drop by more than 37%, costing the industry a whopping
    $46.6 billion a month and nearly $560 billion in a year”. Exact effects depend on how quickly this situation becomes
    under control, however, it is important to consider that the subsiding of the virus, whether it be by containment or
    vaccine, will not return the travel industry to normal, for the economy of the Western world will need healing
    before people will consider taking vacations again. The time away from work and damage to the American and European
    economy will need time to rebuild before globalization returns to normal. So while we in the Global North are
    concerned with rapidly falling gas prices and employment insurance, nations already facing high rates of
    impoverishment who are struggling to accommodate a pandemic with limited resources now have to find ways to support
    a nation facing an unemployment crisis due with minimal GDP income.

    Diminishing international monetary support and federal tax revenue are not the only challenges that are emerging in
    the Global South among this pandemic. A steepening “curve” of COVID-19 case will likely occur in developing
    countries, for two reasons, firstly because these nations lack the sanitary materials and medical institutions to
    limit contamination, and secondly, because for the large majority of the population who faces impoverishment, not
    working in order to self-isolate is not an option. Monetary support from developed countries is the only way to
    maintain a functioning economy in order to protect lives, and return the world to its full efficiency in a timely
    manner. However, a question remains, where is this money going to come from? International economic institutions
    such as the International Monetary Fund is potential option, however it is not sufficient to support the
    international community at the required extent. Undoubtedly, these desperate times reveal more than ever how
    dependency theory exists between developed and developing countries. The World Economic Forum has called upon the G7
    and G20 to take action, however, most states are still trying to establish protocol in their own nations, so the
    Global South is pushed out of discussion. Over the past few weeks, the accelerating spread of the notorious
    coronavirus ignited the Canadian government to announce their $52 billion commitment to COVID-19 aid. Prime Minister
    Trudeau announced this economic contribution gracefully with the intent to support Canadians who depend on
    employment insurance, need medical care and mental health support, and more; however this substantial amount of
    $52,000,000,000 happens to be 37% of Cuba’s annual GDP, and 6.5 times Fiji’s annual GDP. This stunning statistic
    reveals the full extents of disparity between developed and developing. While Canada’s commitment to its citizens is
    admirable, the world as we know it, which is already overwhelmed by perpetuating inequality between the Global North
    and Global South, is only going to suffer further.
</p>
<p>
       Ultimately, a lot more research and investigation is required to reveal the full extent of damage that will
       persist in the Global South, but moving forward it is the responsibility of the international community to not abandon the
       most vulnerable in this time of need. Minimizing the spread of the virus is the first place to start, however the
       conversation of COVID-19’s severe consequences on the Global South in missing from global forum. That said, now is
       the opportunity to raise awareness, and from our self-isolation call upon Global North governmental, NGOs, and
       international institutions to support the cosmopolitan community before preventable damage in developing
       countries becomes irreversible.

    As a development student, I am particularly privy to the world beyond my own. As a shadow of desperate times slowly
    creeps darkness on the world, it is important we do not turn a blind eye to the most vulnerable and at-risk members
    of our cosmopolitan community. Everyday, the Global North, developed countries, uses the Global South, developing
    countries, as a neoliberal means of capitalism economic growth, intertwined in an assemblage known as modern
    globalization. Now, amidst a global pandemic, the Global North is going to extreme measures to protect domestic
    economic values, but disregards the Global South in the process. This article acknowledges another side of the
    COVID-19 pandemic that the media has failed to acknowledge and suggests ways that both state leaders and individuals
    can contribute to providing aid to nations and impoverished populations in the most need of support.
